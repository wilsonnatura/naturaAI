Here’s a clean, professional draft for your GitHub repository’s **README.md** file describing *NaturaMindAI*, your naturopathic LLM project:

````{"variant":"standard","title":"README for NaturaMindAI Repository","id":"19042"}
# 🌿 NaturaMindAI

**NaturaMindAI** is a large language model (LLM)–powered assistant focused on **naturopathic medicine, holistic health, and mind-body wellness**.  
It combines the reasoning power of modern AI models with curated naturopathic knowledge to provide reliable, science-aware, and nature-aligned insights for both practitioners and health enthusiasts.

## 🧠 Core Features

- **Holistic Question Answering** – Understands and responds to questions about herbal medicine, nutrition, stress reduction, and natural healing approaches.  
- **Integrative Reasoning** – Merges conventional medical information with naturopathic perspectives.  
- **Conversational Interface** – Uses LangChain, OpenAI, and Anthropic models for context-rich, memory-aware dialogue.  
- **Ethical & Evidence-Aware** – Designed to provide balanced information, avoiding unsafe or unverified recommendations.

## 🧩 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wilsonnatura/NaturaMindAI.git
cd NaturaMindAI
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate llms
```

Then link your environment to Jupyter:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=llms --display-name "Python (llms)"
```

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root containing your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
```

Make sure `.env` is **not** committed to version control.

---

## 🚀 Usage

Launch the development notebook or app interface:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

or if using Gradio:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then interact with the model via chat or prompt templates.

Would you like me to include a **section for model architecture** (e.g., how the LLM pipeline and prompt management are organized via LangChain)? That can help make your README more technical and appealing to contributors.
